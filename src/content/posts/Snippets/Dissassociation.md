[^1]: Disassociation sneaks up on you. Often you don't even know its happening as you slowly disconnect from yourself. 

[^2]: That disconnection can feel like memories blocked from access.

[^3]: Visual snow, colours grey, objects appearing flat.

[^4]: Misjudgment of object positions, and bodily senses are all symptoms.

[^5]: Derealisation, a term that never resonated, when its was all you knew, what even is ***real***.

[^6]: Depersonalisation, not recognising yourself in the mirror. 

[^7]: Radiohead. 2016. How to Disappear Completely from the album Kid A. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W6HhdqA95w

[^8]: This snippet, a lazy acrostic writing, all I could manage.

[^9]: Thought processing on safe mode, limited capabilities. 

[^10]: I remove myself from others, all operations on standby.

[^11]: Avoid chores, avoid sleep, embrace chaos.

[^12]: Impaired inductive reasoning inferring questionable conclusions. 

[^13]: This website in itself, a week long hyperfixation.

[^14]: Lack of sleep, my debts are paid.<br> Feeling great again!
