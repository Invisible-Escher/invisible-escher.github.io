[^1]: My actual tinder profile during the COVID-19 lockdowns.   
<br> In an unusual period of calm, alone with minimal obligations, as the world sat silent and screaming. Each day I sat with my coffee and watched. Each day I sat and watched this plane of dirt transforming. Expecting this uniform patch of green to terraform, but its growth was as complicated as any other.  
<br> I did in fact buy mixed blend lawn seed.
