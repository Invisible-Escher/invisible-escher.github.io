#### On Monday 21st August 2023, I received my official diagnosis.

It was anticlimactic. I had spent 6-months coming to terms with my suspicions and within that period I can barely describe the sheer amount of weirdness I've experienced on a sensory level. I've had my sense of focus become detached from control. The contrast of life turned all the way up. The proximity of noises collapsing in on itself.[^1] I've discovered large chunks of episodic memory missing from my perception, followed by rapid uncontrollable flashbacks forcing a period of medical leave.[^2] All of this sounds very extreme - and it was. But none of this compares to this ever-present psychological sense of permanent disconnection and distance I've felt from all other people, my entire life.[^3] A feeling so strong it manifests in my vision as a translucent barrier with near physicality. A wall between us. An impermeable existence beyond my being that cannot be breached.

Chances are if you have met me, you've never really known me. No matter how long we've known each other for.[^4] I've described the sensation as if feeling alien on a planet filled with scary humans. After my diagnosis, with greater clarity, an understanding of the abstraction. I now liken this sensation to being an anthropologist from Mars - I am present but foreign to all others.[^5] Throughout my life I've been filtering the way I speak, the way I act, the way I move, down to the expressions I make.[^6] This isn't a choice or rather it isn't a choice I am able to avoid.[^7] Any attempts to act authentically in that way which is innate to me is misunderstood at best. Often received in confusion, proving cognitively taxing to others as if my line of thinking runs counter to the typical - to which it does.[^8] At worst it is met with hostility, as if I've breached the social order of what normal interaction should be.[^9] If you've known me for a while, perhaps you've experienced me as being relatively quiet but very considerate. A quiet reflection. A moment of silence as I enact  mandatory prescribed considerations.[^10] Considerations of actions and reactions in real time. Considerations cultivated over a lifetime. Consider any attempts of 'being myself', too frequently rebuked to 'but not like that', perhaps not said directly but certainly revealed in the minute (or not so minute) reactions held by others.

> _“I had virtually no socially-shared nor consciously, intentionally expressed, personhood beyond this performance of a non-autistic ‘normality’ with which I had neither comprehension, connection, nor identification. This disconnected constructed facade was accepted by the world around me when my true and connected self was not. Each spoonful of its acceptance was a shovel full of dirt on the coffin in which my real self was being buried alive...”_ [^11]

So now what? Well, in the 6-months leading up to the formal diagnosis I had experimented with dropping the act. Only to be quickly reminded of why I started in the first place. When I act natural, I'm met with confusion. If I reveal my diagnosis, I am infantilised.[^12] I am often offered unsolicited sympathy - sympathy for what?[^13] I'm at odds on how to broach this new information bestowed on me. I've been tasked with navigating this haze of confusion and misgivings without a map. The responsibility is mine alone - same as it ever was.[^14] Certainly, it has been easier having an explanation to why this social weirdness keeps happening. As if accepting an external force beyond my control, and yet it doesn't change the division it causes - at least for those not also autistic.[^15]

I'll say this, I don't need comfort. I don't feel any lesser than. Only different. While I do encounter real physical issues, the sociological aspects at least for me have been the most challenging.[^2] A sociological phenomenon inflicting disassociations.[^4][^5] A disability found in nature by virtue defined by the participation of two parties.[^2] A failure in communication.[^2] An inability to empathise.[^2] A perceptual mismatch of salience as defined by asymmetric perspectives.[^2] An illogical labelling of social deficits and misinterpretations inherently tied to intersubjective experiences.[^2] A deficit in communication? or a deficit in understanding? Misguided at best. Malicious at worst. 

I'm struck by the oxymoronic status of my diagnosis.[^2] This unusual stigma attached to a label that elicits all to inform me on how okay everything will be. I'm confused. You misunderstand. Nothing has changed. I didn't acquire a new condition. I've known my condition just as I have always known. I've always known. Only now do I have words to ascribe to this knowing and knowledge that there are others who also know. I sought this diagnosis. As if to presume others would not rightly believe the introspection I hold to the contents of my own mind.[^2] My own lifeworld.[^2] A life experienced.[^2] A life lived.[^2] There seems to be a misconception. Some confusion has occurred. Where is this unsolicited sympathy originating? Just what is it that you all think that I am feeling?[^2] Some seeming failure in cognitive empathy is occurring and it's all very confusing.[^2] Is this part of the assessment?[^2] 

This just in. I've just been informed. Breaking news. An update on the situation. A fascinating discovery. We have a diagnosis. Possession of a rare condition where most everyone misinterprets your thoughts, feelings and communications. I'm sorry, what? Excuse me? Was there a memo about this? I had no idea people could read minds. Is it backwards day? Am I understanding this correctly? Assumptions are being made. Widespread misinterpretations made by someone who is not me. Makes total sense. I understand now. And I'm the one with the condition you say? Absolutely, a perfectly logical conclusion.[^2] Well done. I applaud your inductive reasoning.[^2] Message received. Thoughts and prayers. My heart goes out to everyone afflicted. Just one last question, where do I send the flowers?[^22]
