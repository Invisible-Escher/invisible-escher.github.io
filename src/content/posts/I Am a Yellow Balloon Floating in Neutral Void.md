> Autistic adults experience complex emotions, a revelation that could shape better therapy for neurodivergent people. To a group of autistic adults, giddiness manifests like “bees”; small moments of joy like “a nice coffee in the morning”; anger starts with a “body-tensing” boil, then headaches.[^1]

Bewilderment feels like my eyeballs going so wide they're about to wrap around my skull — then headaches.

###### *I am a yellow balloon floating in neutral void*

###### *I am falling down a flight of stairs where spikes protrude from the walls*

###### *My head is a bag of bees and my body is on autopilot* 

###### *My body is worn down scaffolding held together by bungee cords*

###### *I am an amoeba, an amorphous blob ever shifting unable to maintain a consistent shape*

## _My brain has left the building_

###### 

I've been describing my emotions to my therapist like this for last year an half. I feel unable to fully relate with others given the depth and complexity of how I feel emotions.[^3] Previously unable to comprehend a seeming tsunami of 'feelings'. Like invisible radiation. From a gentle waves to world ending catastrophes, they all carry debris in with the deluge.[^4] </br></br>

[^3]: Alexithymia, also called emotional blindness, is a neuropsychological phenomenon characterized by significant challenges in recognizing, expressing, sourcing, and describing one's emotions.

[^4]: I am receiving my emotions like a tangled spaghetti of fairy lights. Like a thoroughly blended assortment of cause and affect. Like a manual sorting of past search histories. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg&t=317s

##### _I am a cloud floating among the birds_

My hands are shaking and yet I feel nothing. I'm ingesting too much information. I'm simulating too much complexity.[^5] I am assuming nuance in a way which the complexity of individual emotional states are completely indiscernible from any other.[^6] Its funny, or rather not at all. 
I've been told I lack empathy and compassion. I've been told there rules of validation. I've read that to comfort someone, I need affirm what others are feeling and normalise their experience. And yet that doesn't work for me.[^7] </br></br>

When others attempt to posit my emotions, my experience, my feelings, it feels confronting. It feels insulting.[^9] As if others are making light of what an experience that encompasses depth to which words cannot be affixed. A comparative notion that everyone feels this way. Just regular human experience. Just feeling like an entire experiential existence being gas lit.[^11] </br></br>

##### _I am receiving my emotions in GIFs_

Everything is complicated. Emotions are messy. Emotions are intertwined with all of which we've ever experienced, everyone we've ever meet, every interaction we've ever had. Emotions are felt in ways which encompass our entire lives, they reflect our history in the world. Lives that are lived differently. Lives that are experienced differently. Moments are shared but are they ever felt in the same way? Emotions that cannot be compared. Only understood. </br></br>
