<br>

#### How did you make this website?
Its largely based on [grant's blog](https://danielgrants.com/) who has graciously shared his code on github.[^2] I can't tell you how difficult it was to find a nice sidenote implementation that suited my needs and I am eternally grateful to this stranger. <sub>Who I will never contact.. <sub>Thank you</sub></sub>

#### Are you going to post anything useful?
Maybe. Eventually. Don't hold me on it. I'm not trying to make this my job.[^3]
For now I've reached the end of this cycle of fixation, I may return to post at some point. There is a backlog.
But other things are drawing my attention now.[^4] I hope the sidenotes can provide some guidance as to what you seek.[^5]

Alright, good chat. Hope that sufficient.
